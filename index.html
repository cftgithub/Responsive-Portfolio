                    <p>"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"...or NOT!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>I am passionate about fixing things and making them better. Today, technology (and life) is moving at hyper speed and in order to keep up,
                        you must develop improvements before it is needed. Waiting until something breaks before fixing it is a guaranteed path to obsolescence.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have 20 plus years of experience in fixing and improving "things" in government and private sectors and have executed innovative solutions 
                        to underperforming programs in addition to implementing new projects and procedures. I am currently expanding my skills and knowledge in the technology 
                        field with languages and platforms such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Java Script and React.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before becoming a web developer, I was a supervisor in charge of operations at the Transportation Security Administration Coordination Center at 
                        Salt Lake City International Airport, serving within the Office of Security Operations under the direction of Homeland Security. I was reponsible for 
                        managing and supervising Coordination Center officers in addition to collaborating with local, state and federal agencies to ensure operational security programs 
                        are properly applied and implemented. I also developed and implemented multiple procedural changes to improve efficiency, increase teamwork and improve morale,  
                        and fascilitated training to ensure that the officers are utilizing available technology to its fullest potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy gardening, cooking, playing the piano and giving back to the community by volunteering at non-profit organizations.
